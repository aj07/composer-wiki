# Meetings

We have a weekly meetings where we discuss:

* What's new - what work has gone in recently, a "show and tell" of what we have achieved.
* Retrospective - what has been going well, or not so well, and how can we improve?
* What's coming - what are we planning to do next, review designs for future work, etc.

The meetings run on an alternating call schedule. We are running the meetings on an alternating schedule as we would like to ensure that everyone gets a chance to participate - regardless of their timezone ðŸ˜„ 

Week (A) meetings are held at 4pm UTC (5pm UK, 12pm ET, 9am PT).  
Week (B) meetings are held at 9am UTC (10am UK, 2:30pm IST, 5pm CST).
