# Meetings

We have a biweekly meeting where we discuss:

* What's new - what work has gone in recently, a "show and tell" of what we have achieved.
* Retrospective - what has been going well, or not so well, and how can we improve?
* What's coming - what are we planning to do next, review designs for future work, etc.

This meeting is held at 4pm UTC (4pm UK, 11am ET, 8am PT).
